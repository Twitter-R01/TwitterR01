TSV data files created for D1, D2, D3 and D4 with all sub-fields from original annotated files. These contain all annotation fields for now, which will be removed when datasets are converted to dictionaries. Subsets generated according to issue https://github.com/CRMTH/TwitterR01/issues/18:

-	D1: Complete annotated dataset where each tweet is annotated as relevant / not relevant
-	D2: Subset of D1 where all tweets are relevant and each tweet is annotated as commercial / not commercial
-	D3: Subset of D2 where all tweets are not commercial and each tweet is annotated as pro-vape / anti-vape / not-pro /not-anti
